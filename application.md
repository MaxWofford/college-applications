Around my sophomore year of high school I began creatively writing in my free time. Soon I posted my stories online. I found other writers and storytellers, and began talking about my experiences and use of creative tools with them. After a long brainstorming session, I decided to collaboratively write with another science-fantasy writer. We would write alternating chapters each week from the perspective of different characters without discussing what we wrote ahead of time. We have just completed are just over 100 pages, and still working on it.

I look up from the laptop’s screen and pan my eyes in an arc. The softly lit silhouettes of twenty programmers, hackers, and founders are outlined in their screen-light as they type away on their laptops. The ones in hammocks vibrantly display expressions as they video-chat with loved ones and co-founders outside of Costa Rica. Jon, an organizer of Penn Apps, sits at the center of the room and meditates. I stretch my legs to keep the blood flowing. I'm standing at the bar while typing, two people pair programming on the laptop to my left. 

I wasn’t always on this path. For most of my life my goal was to become a mechanical engineer. I lived and breathed my goal. I was so far ahead of my engineering class I began to believe I was inherently good at any STEM field, but physics class was just the opposite for me. 

My goal to become an engineer was becoming fast tracked. Over summer, I took metal machining classes with laser cutters, mills, and lathes. My laptop was overheating, so I designed and 3D-printed a kick-stand for it (these were sold to classmates).  I mentored at a local middle school robotics club, then led my high school’s robotics club as president for two years.

Junior year I hit a wall in STEM. I could not understand the material in my physics class regardless of how long I studied. Maybe it was my teacher; it was his first year teaching, and he started with quantum mechanics the first week. Maybe my difficulty was because I hadn't gone through calculus yet, which is an integral part of physics, but maybe it was me. I was relying on my basic traits to carry me through a subject I had no understanding of.

Since I knew I'd need to know how to program for my senior year engineering class, I decided to learn to code to avoid being adrift next time. I taught myself, in my own direction, and didn’t rely on someone to show me the way.  I googled "how to code," and started going through the first tutorial I could find. After going through a quick tutorial on how to make a site by Codecademy.com, I started building my own projects for practice throughout the summer.  And, because of what I had taught myself over summer, I completed the first two months worth of classwork in two days.

Learning to code did have some consequences that I wish I had avoided. Perhaps by focusing less on programming I would have focused better on my grades during senior year. Maybe I could have been a better leader on my robotics team had I not been staying up long nights, playing and prototyping in a new language. But, beyond these consequences were other benefits. 

Programming has introduced me to a whole new open community with a self-driven work-ethic. There is an openness to programming that doesn’t exist in most engineering disciplines. Projects are open-source, tutorials are free, and other programmers are accessible.  And, at the Hacker’s Paradise in Costa Rica I’ve decided to focus on growing as a full stack developer. My goal is to commit open-source code a minimum of once per day, then keep track of it. Making dynamic websites with frameworks such as Sinatra, Express, and Rails.

The decision to learn programming on my own was a turning point in my life. It marked a change that defined for me what I could accomplish on my own. That difference helps maintain my focus and interest in programming and led me to participate in the LAUNCH Hackathon where my team earned 3rd place and secured $33K in investments for our mobile application, won the Userapp API prize at SoHacks, and build and maintain my own crypto-currency web-store. If given the choice, I would make the same decision again.
